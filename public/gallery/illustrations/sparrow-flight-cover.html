        <p class="tagline" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px;"><i>Originally drawn: 8 September 2024</i></p>
        <p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://sparrowflightproject.web.app/stories/story-1.html">Read the story this drawing came from!</a></p>
        
        <p>SPARROW FLIGHT was a very impulsive, though premeditated, project I started last year! It began when the Delta Green TTRPG campaign this project came out of begun.</p>
        <p>I began writing things for fun, because it has been a very long time ever since I've written without perfectionistic tendencies that got rid of the fun from writing. After writing a handful of stories, I entertained the idea of compiling these stories and posting them online just because I had them.</p>
        <p>Not as a proper novel, though: that would give me extra pressure to pay more attention to the overarching linearity and continuity of the stories (aka more planning in advance), so I wouldn't really have the freedom to write whatever I want, whenever I want. (Plus, the events of this project are influenced by how the campaign goes which, as a player, is unknown to me.)</p>
        <p>This is why SPARROW FLIGHT's format is more of an anthology/collection of short stories and comics rather than a full length novel, and why its chronology isn't linear. Sometimes, the order of the stories is important since it provides important, additional context to subsequent stories. And sometimes, I just get an idea and I want to write it out lol. That's why I list both narrative and written order under Timeline: the former lets you see things in retrospect, while the latter gives the TTRPG experience of having things revealed one at a time. (Aka I want to have my cake and eat it too)</p>
        <p style="text-align: center">Anyway, the impulsivity of starting this project resulted in this painting being VERY impulsive too.</p>
        <p>For some context, the Vorobyevs first came from a D&D4e game in which Hrodwyn, the eldest child, was my player character (so the 'main character' of the story) (they were a sparrow-shifter btw, that's why the family's surname means 'sparrow' and why this project is named what it is). I first made/designed them on 6 September. Then I thought, won't it be funny to launch SPARROW FLIGHT on their birthday?</p>

        <p style="text-align: center">As you can see from the date I finished this painting above, that did not happen LMAO but I was close! That was on me. It was an impulsive decision to think that I could use an entirely new style of painting I've never done before to paint four figures in four days or something. I think this took 7 days in the end? Which is longer than how much time my polished stuff usually takes. But it was a good learning experience for me! I definitely want to try to paint like this more often, and go truly lineless while I'm at it. (This painting was supposed to be lineless. I don't know why I added them back. It took so long.) (and hehe amogus)</p>

        <p style="text-align: center">On the more technical end, I didn't use a lot of layers for the actual painting itself (as in, without the buildings and sparrows and text). I had the orange underpaint on one layer, and everything else above it. This is how I do my other digital paintings in my other style -- I want to work similarly to how you'd paint traditionally, which meant not relying on layers. But when it came to the background, I gave up and did it on a new layer just because it was way more convenient, and because I was running out of time. It'll be stupid of me to not use the efficiency of digital art programs.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center">Here's a timelapse of most of the week's worth of work. You can tell I was really trying to emulate traditinoal painting with that palette, haha (and you should watch it while the music's playing for the vibes, hehe)</p>

        <p style="text-align: center">And finally! Here are also some art composition symbolism things I tried to incorperate into this painting:</p>

        <p style="text-align: center">1. I intentionally wanted a very blue and desaturated colour scheme because, despite the happy/wholesome family scene, I didn't want it to feel happy -- I wanted a layer of sadness to it. Cuz that's the Vorobyevs in a nutshell, little everyday happiness strung together with an unspoken grief that runs deep</p>

        <p style="text-align: center">2. The sparrow Gavrill's looking at is/represents Leyna/Merlin, his wife :) and the other 4 are the children the two have lost (Leyna has the adult white-crowned sparrow plumage, but the rest have juvenille plumage since they all died as kids)</p>

        <p style="text-align: center">3. Gavrill looks directly at a ghost sparrow/notices it because, unlike his kids who ignore it/can't see it, he's the only one left in the family who witnessed all 5 deaths and has intense trauma + grief directly from it</p>

        <p style="text-align: center">4. The kids keep looking forward and up because, unlike Gavrill, they're capable and, especially, <i>willing</i> to move on from grief/trauma</p>

        <p style="text-align: center">5. Oh also blue is Gavrill's colour, orange is Leyna's colour :) of course their colours are complementary</p>
