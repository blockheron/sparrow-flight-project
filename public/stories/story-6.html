    <p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">This letter was written in a sketchbook stored in Agent HROTHGAR&rsquo;s locker. It is written in a blend of Ingush and Russian.</span></em></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operation STATIC SHOCK<br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">13 FEB 2017</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First operation. Helvetia Branch 4 headquarters in Rio, Brazil. Amaia is late, and Melydice immediately jumps on the opportunity to tell it&rsquo;s a good habit to be on time. What a great start. I am not looking forward to her talkative presence.</span></p>
    <div class="indented">
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arquette tells us about the case. A static worm came out of a man. Two people have been bit. No one knows how it happened or what it means, but he has an idea: it&rsquo;s because of a drug people have been trying to send out. He doesn&rsquo;t know where it&rsquo;s from. I guess that&rsquo;s our job now.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He drops a duffel on the table: 1 pistol for each of us. He empties the bag and leaves as Fisher enters, who mutters about missing the meeting. Again, Melydice scolds him. Even though we flew here on the same plane, he apparently had another meeting before this one.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arquette immediately starts walking out. Fisher chases after him and we follow. We go outside to see the van we&rsquo;ll be using: a Benz sprinter. The kind I&rsquo;ll tell the kids to avoid. We use it to go to the crime scene, an apartment. Arquette starts it. Fisher sits in shotgun, opens a laptop, and we go in. God, it was really fucking hot in there. But if I took our uniform jacket off, Arquette will scold me. Or worse, Melydice.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of Melydice, she mentions logistical issues with another agent to Arquette. I thought it was about Molly, who was supposed to be here. But apparently she wasn&rsquo;t here because of food poisoning (she ate seafood for her birthday). Anyway, Arquette tells Melydice to leave the files on his desk. I don&rsquo;t think the rest of us were supposed to hear that, because he looks back at us after saying that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">while driving</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Fisher takes over the wheel while that happens.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&rsquo;re still on the way to the apartment. I&rsquo;ll continue writing after we investigate.</span></p>
    </div>
    <p style="text-align: center;">&mdash;</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We arrive. The three junkies and the five cops are there. Arquette parks and tells us to get out. He and Fisher are only here to babysit (they have another task to do). So I go talk to the police and the junkies immediately. I don&rsquo;t want to spend more time here than necessary. I ask them what happened. One of them wonders if they&rsquo;re allowed to tell us. I don&rsquo;t know what to do, so I look at our babysitters. Arquette mouths, &ldquo;Lie&rdquo;.</span></p>
    <div class="indented">
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is going terribly already.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melydice does the talking again. She says we&rsquo;re back up. Obviously they don&rsquo;t know who we are, who called us in, and know none of us are locals. But I guess they&rsquo;re shaken enough to let it slip. He tells us about the call to the apartment. A worm came out of someone&rsquo;s chest like the &ldquo;conjuring&rdquo; (I don&rsquo;t know what that is).&nbsp;</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, Melydice takes charge of the group. She suggests searching the apartment and investigating wounds. Yona checks the junkie&rsquo;s and officer&rsquo;s wound: swollen, developed new tissue (Metasised? Metastasized? I don&rsquo;t know what that is), and static-like. The junkie&rsquo;s scar is worse than the officer&rsquo;s. Melydice then says to split the group: two to talk to junkies (Tatsu, Melydice), three to search the apartment (Amaia, Yona, me).</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three of us see the body the worm tore through. Yona inspects the body. She says its nerve channels are scrambled, repurposed by alien signals. The pineal gland also grew a radar organ that broadcasted signals. I don&rsquo;t understand what any of that means, but it doesn&rsquo;t sound good.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I use the UV light on my gun to look for the drugs. They weren&rsquo;t good at hiding them. It&rsquo;s just in the cupboard: small vials of glowing pink liquid. I give it to Yona. She asks me what drug I think it is. I don&rsquo;t know why.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amaia figures out the drug&rsquo;s taken with a syringe, so I suggest looking for them. I help Yona with my UV light. She finds one syringe easily with equipment to test drug purity. I continue shining normal light on her. Yona reads the test results and says the drug is nootropic (heightens senses). Fisher was right. She is useful.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, I search the bag the needle came from. It&rsquo;s filled with university textbooks and notebooks. A student&rsquo;s. I take the bag. Amaia checks the body and finds a wallet. His name was Ted, 22. He was just three years older than Hrodwyn. Poor kid.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I check for any signs of other people being here, and then we leave to join Melydice and Tatsu.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside, they tell us about their talk with the junkies (Vito, Mike). Vito thinks he needs to go to a hospital. Melydice says he will, after answering her questions. So he does. The flat belonged to Ted. Vito and Mike were there only for a hit. Neither are the suppliers. This was Ted&rsquo;s third time taking the drug. It&rsquo;s the first for Vito and Mike.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vito said the drug was called &ldquo;Pink&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Fuzz&rdquo;. It lets you see everything, like &ldquo;mega LSD&rdquo;. It lets you see everything, and everything sees you. At the crime scene after taking the drug, Ted opened his mouth. Static came out, and then the worm came out and bit Vito.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melydice asks where Ted got the drug from. He got it at a comic store. He used a sign up sheet for a game room (Magi Nation, Jyhad, some dead game), asked for 30 minutes, and the dealers showed up. Vito and Mike have never gone to the store.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tatsu gets his turn and asks Vito how he and Mike knew Ted and the drugs (Ted was their university friend). And then he tells him how things aren&rsquo;t so fun with drugs involved. Vito tells him to fuck off. Even then, Tatsu tries to medicate Vito&rsquo;s wound, even though he has no idea what to do with it. What a strange man.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melydice reconfirms if it was Vito and Mike&rsquo;s first time. Vito confirms. He says they saw other worlds with the drug and refuse to take it again. He also tells us there are other users besides the three of them. They all know to sign up for the dead game.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the way, while this was happening, Vito keeps asking Melydice to go to a hospital and to see a doctor. And each time, Melydice tells him she&rsquo;ll let him only after he answers her questions. It&rsquo;s good that she&rsquo;s efficient. That&rsquo;ll get me home sooner. But I remember he&rsquo;s just a kid and feel a bit bad for him. In the end, Yona was the one who treated Vito.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melydice starts questioning the bitten officer. She asks if it was a wild animal report. The officer says yes. And then Melydice insists that it </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">was </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">a wild animal he saw. The officer describes the same thing as the one before and whenever he says monster, Melydice talks over him to say wild animal. I don&rsquo;t know how convincing she thinks she is&hellip;</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is when an officer approaches Arquette and Fisher to ask them questions. So I walk between them, tell Arquette we&rsquo;re done and we can leave. But the officer still tries asking me who we are. I tell him it&rsquo;s not his business. He says it is. I don&rsquo;t know what to say. But Melydice likes to talk and she&rsquo;s good at talking to people. So I point at Melydice. Ask her. Not me.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That worked. He goes to her. As she says we&rsquo;re private investigators working under an NDA for a private health firm, I see her slip her wallet out, and she makes sure the officer sees it. I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised she&rsquo;s not above that. And I figure I should be there for extra support, unfortunately, if things go dirty.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&rsquo;t really follow what she says, but standing there seemed to work. The officer asks us to &ldquo;show credentials&rdquo; but instead, brings us aside and opens his hand, expecting money. I am </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spending a single cent for the job. So it&rsquo;s good that Melydice is. The officer takes her money.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, it has been 1 hour and 20 minutes. Cops have been here 15 minutes: they&rsquo;ve been here for 1h and 45 minutes total. In that time, Vito&rsquo;s wound went from the fresh state of the officer&rsquo;s to the worse state it is in now. We don&rsquo;t have much time.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We agree on a plan: Arquette and Fisher will drive the victims to a hospital and will drop us off at Stoneburner Comics (we got the address from one of the junkies). Fisher also changes into his suit, for some reason. It&rsquo;s a 15 minute drive to the comic store. We just arrived, so I&rsquo;ll continue writing later.</span></p>
    </div>
    <p style="text-align: center;">&mdash;</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The comic store is empty, except for some people. The sign up sheet at the front is easy to find. 20 people have signed up for dead games. 20 people have signed up for death.</span></p>
    <div class="indented">    
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melydice takes a picture of the list and writes down Yona&rsquo;s name. Hm. The store owner sees us and reaches for his phone. I thought he was onto us. So I walk over and put his phone down. Just in case. I say we&rsquo;re only here for a good time. He doesn&rsquo;t say anything.&nbsp;</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can&rsquo;t fucking believe what I&rsquo;m about to do. You would </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">never</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> let me live this down.&nbsp;</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sling my arm over Melydice&rsquo;s shoulder to convince him that we&rsquo;re only here for a good time with friends. That was all for fucking nothing, because he wasn&rsquo;t convinced. So I try to ask who he was calling, but he&rsquo;s too scared to answer! Why is he so scared? I don&rsquo;t understand. I&rsquo;m trying very hard to be nice, especially with my arm around fucking Melydice. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d agree. Right?</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melydice does calm him down in the end, and the owner says that he was going to call the dealers&hellip; until I put the phone down. God. What a sick joke. How was I supposed to know?? He could&rsquo;ve just told me. At least Melydice has talked sense into the owner and I can leave. But Melydice holds the back of my jacket so I can&rsquo;t. Bastard. At least I can write all this down before the dealers get here.</span></p>
    </div>
    <p style="text-align: center;">&mdash;</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">20 minutes later, Arquette calls Melydice from the hospital. He&rsquo;s posing as a doctor and says the kids&rsquo; wounds are growing. Since Melydice has the information on the wounds and drugs, he asks her for help. Melydice calls Yona outside for her to relay what she knows to Henri. She thinks amputation is not a good idea, but remembers the radar organ in the pineal gland. In the living victims, the radar may be sending or receiving signals. She suggests surgery to remove it. Arquette tells Fisher to find out if there is a basement: if there is, put the victims there. If that doesn&rsquo;t work, trepanation. He speaks French and hangs up.</span></p>
    <div class="indented">
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the dealers arrive, and we go into a game room. The dealers are 2 people. First: 7&rsquo; man, shit posture, bald patch on neck. He doesn&rsquo;t have hair. Instead, it&rsquo;s&hellip; long, thin cattails poking out of his head? Second: 5&rsquo; woman, all muscle, looks very sunburnt except for the glyph on her head. Strangely, I think I recognise it. Maybe from a book I&rsquo;ve seen. It&rsquo;s from another world, so she&rsquo;s definitely not from this place. Maybe from this planet, but not of this&hellip; realm. Maybe you&rsquo;d known more about it, Lin. Ah, but if you were here, I wouldn&rsquo;t bring you into this mess.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man is the one who talks. He asks how many we want. Melydice asks how many they have. The man opens his bag, showing 20 vials. Tatsu asks if they&rsquo;re the only suppliers, and the man says they are.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I ask how much it is. It&rsquo;s 4000 Real. God. I&rsquo;m not spending that much for this job, and I&rsquo;m especially NOT spending that much for drugs! I say it&rsquo;s too expensive and leave. The rest follow. The dealers are upset and stare at us, but I don&rsquo;t care. All I need to do is know their car. I see it, write down the licence plate in this sketchbook, and draw the symbol on the woman&rsquo;s head. Melydice calls Fisher to pick us up.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Arquette and Fisher arrive, I show them my sketchbook. Fisher goes to his computer and gets the car&rsquo;s information. It includes the owner's apartment address. We leave immediately.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fisher drives fast. Very fast. Arquette quickly gives our breaching order. Tatsu goes in first with his sword (why is he using a sword??). I&rsquo;m next to throw a flashbang to cover him. Melydice gets the shotgun and goes next. Amaia and Yona are door guards.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We arrive. As Fisher and Arquette wait at separate exits, we don our kevlar vests and scopes and storm up to the fourth floor. Tatsu kicks down the door, and the skull on the table screams like a death whistle.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My gut tightens. Melydice kicks the skull. It shatters and stops screaming. The dealers aren&rsquo;t here but others will hear it. We need to move fast.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Messy room. Takeout boxes everywhere. There&rsquo;s a couch with a broken frame. Something heavy broke it, maybe. A pile of laundry behind it. I smell it before seeing it. Oily. Disgusting. There&rsquo;s also a blue-grey metal gong on the wall. It doesn&rsquo;t have any symbols on it.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rooms: living room, bedroom, bathroom, kitchen. Amaia and Yona stand guard. Melydice checks the bedroom. I cover her. There&rsquo;s a wardrobe and closet. The bed&hellip; is a mess. Medication, handguns, blood and&hellip; semen samples, candy, and coloured lamps shaped like a round cartoon cat. Very cute. Hygd might like it. Melydice checks under the bed. There&rsquo;s nothing. I open one of the candies. Normal candy. I check the sample labels. Only has names and words &lsquo;blood&rsquo; or &lsquo;semen&rsquo;.&nbsp;</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melydice checks the closet. I watch her back. No clothes. But there&rsquo;s a body. McDonalds cashier. Opened up. Missing organs. Walls smeared with no-scent incense. No wonder there&rsquo;s no smell. But I can imagine it. He was just a kid. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Really </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">still a kid. He was just Merethel&rsquo;s age. 17 years old.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melydice asks Yona to inspect the body while calling her &ldquo;sweetie&rdquo;... Meanwhile, I shine UV light on the corpse, the closet (just smears), and the rest of the room. There&rsquo;s nothing much. Melydice checks the wardrobe. It&rsquo;s designed to suspend a person (there&rsquo;s a harness dangling from the top).</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melydice checks on Yona and asks if something is wrong, as if there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with a teenager being ripped apart. Yona says his chest was crudely opened and it is empty. Heart, lungs, stomach, liver, all gone. Though his pancreas is still there. There are signs of struggle: he was serrated open while alive. I&rsquo;ve seen all sorts of things before. You know that, Lin. But this&hellip; now that the job&rsquo;s done, my mind keeps going back to Merethel.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, Melydice thanks her. The kid has no identification on him, so I take a picture of his face and the room. I wonder if his parents know. They should.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tatsu checks the kitchen: cabinets, oven, a fridge. He opens the fridge. There are sheets and sheets of fatty skin marinating in plastic bags, their colours changing to the light. The oven has wooden boxes. The cabinet has lighters, incense, crystal necklaces. Tatsu goes back to the boxes to open them, and there&rsquo;s a shit ton of Pink.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the bedroom, I check for fingerprints on the items on the bed again with my UV light. I ask Yona to record the fingerprints, and we both gather the rest of the evidence. Yona categorises them to bag them. For the 5 handguns, I turn on the safety, unload them, keep one magazine on me and hand one to Yona. She thanks me. I distribute the other magazines to the other agents. Tatsu joins us to help.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amaia suddenly locks the door and puts a chair under the handle. We stare at her. She says she hears the dealers&rsquo; voices echoing up the stairwell. They&rsquo;re coming. There&rsquo;s no key. The dealers have it on them.&nbsp;</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I quickly check the bathroom. There are two sets of helmets and &ldquo;shoulder pads&rdquo; (I searched it up later: gorget). On the shower curtains are glyphs. They look like computer writing. I tell the other agents. Melydice and Tatsu checks.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melydice reads the glyphs:</span></p>
    </div>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WHEN THE CURTAIN IS DRAWN FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER, THE GATE OPENS.</span></p>
    <div class="indented">
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tatsu reads more:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></p>
    </div>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SHOULD YOU OPEN IT, THE AIR WILL FREEZE. IT WILL LEAD TO THE FEATURELESS PLANE AND THE MONITOR WILL CARRY YOU TO THE BORDERWORLD. THE WHIPLASH IS FATAL WITHOUT NECK PROTECTION.</span></p>
    <div class="indented">
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tatsu also tells us about the Pink in the oven. But there&rsquo;s no time to do anything about it now! We put our backs to the wall: Melydice to one side of the door, Tatsu to the other. We hear them coming, talking in a strange language. Amaia hears the woman fiddle with the keys and twist it. The man says something in a low tone. They speak in hushed voices.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then the man speaks in English. He stutters. &ldquo;What-what-what do-do you-you-you want?&rdquo;</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprisingly, he seems&hellip; genuine. Open to talk. And nervous. Good. I ask if he wants to live. Silence. Then, from the other side of the door, after whispering with the woman, the man says the gong blocks out sound from the room. If we want to negotiate, we open the door.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melydice removes the chair from the doorknob and opens the door. She tells them to put their hands on their heads and walk in. The outer layer of the woman&rsquo;s skin looks like it&rsquo;s made of stone, while the man&rsquo;s skin is peeling off. Tatsu notices the skin looks like the one in the fridge.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they see our guns, the man, who&rsquo;s 2 feet taller than the woman, tries to hide behind her. He&rsquo;s trembling. Melydice says there&rsquo;s nothing to be scared of if they follow our instructions. The man grips the woman&rsquo;s shoulders. She shrugs them off. Tries to. Says she&rsquo;ll put her hands up because the man&rsquo;s too much of a bitch to.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We keep the guns on them. Melydice keeps threatening them. The woman says not to do anything funny and threatens us with two stone eggs in her hands&hellip;</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I notice the man eyes the bathroom. I follow his gaze and look back at him with a raised eyebrow. The woman says to not look at him, to look at her, and to ask her questions.&nbsp;</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amaia closes the door. Melydice asks where they get the drugs from. The woman asks why, saying we probably already have some. But we don&rsquo;t care about that. We want to know where they&rsquo;re from. The woman says &lsquo;Mechanics&rsquo;.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melydice asks her to elaborate, but the woman instead comments about how calm we are, as if we&rsquo;ve seen these things before. (No idea what they&rsquo;re talking about, but all right.) She explains they&rsquo;re not from this world, which is obvious at this point. Then she explains where they get the drug from. Pink is fuel they get from mechanics of their world that&rsquo;s used to fix communication devices. They sell it here because it&rsquo;s cheap back home. They come here, take human materials (the ones on the bed), and sell them back at their home.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I ask about the skin in the fridge. They&rsquo;re disguises to look like humans. It&rsquo;s what the man wears, but it doesn&rsquo;t look good on him. He&rsquo;s too stressed for it to work. I ask about the kid in the closet. Organ trafficking. Some things still stay the same across worlds, huh?</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also ask what the rock eggs do. She asks if we want to find out. Tatsu and I say no. As Melydice reaches to her pocket, the woman&rsquo;s hands tighten around the eggs. But all Melydice wants to do is to call Arquette.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some time later, we hear his voice: &ldquo;Room service.&rdquo; Amaia opens the door. Arquette and Fisher enter. Fisher&rsquo;s two fists are held in front of him and when the door closes, a flaming sword appears in his hands. You would&rsquo;ve loved seeing that. The sword, I mean. It sounds like the story about the sword in the stone you tell me about. The one with Merlin, right?</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arquete gets more information out of the drug dealers. They&rsquo;re from a city called the Borderworld, made by extinct aliens. It&rsquo;s filled with refugees from other universes. Traffickers, sorcerers, slavers, awful people. Also slaves. These two go between both worlds through gates like the bathroom, trying to keep low because both worlds hate them. So they do a bad job in both worlds. Money&rsquo;s tight. They have a hard time keeping it. Besides Pink, they also sell machetes (made out of meteoric iron, intricately engraved, very useful for combat), protective equipment, necklaces (good for defence, guns will be useless with them).</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, instead of killing them or arresting them, Arquette decides to negotiate with them for some goddamn reason. If they stop selling drugs and stop killing people, Helvetia will keep them alive as payment for their goods. He continues to threaten the woman, cornering her, and intimidates her into dropping the stone eggs, the snake. She complies. Nothing happens.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arquette tells Melydice to bag the eggs as evidence and to take them away. We can handle the aliens as we please. As we do so, Melydice tells them they&rsquo;re lucky we were told not to kill them. The woman also spits out an amulet and her skin turns to normal.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hold Fisher back. Since he&rsquo;s the computer guy I thought he could, I don&rsquo;t know, track the kid&rsquo;s face and find his parents. And I don&rsquo;t need to use English to talk to him. He says he&rsquo;ll take care of it. No parent wouldn&rsquo;t want to know their kid has been torn up like that. It&rsquo;ll be a closed casket funeral, and he&rsquo;ll find the kid&rsquo;s parents.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&rsquo;re the last to leave. Fisher tells me that even if it doesn&rsquo;t look like it, this was a job well done. It sure as hell doesn&rsquo;t feel like it. It doesn&rsquo;t feel like anything.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone gets in the van. The woman and man are handcuffed. Arquette fixes the disguise on the man, looks through the evidence bags, and keeps one of the cat lamps. I&rsquo;m glad I kept one in my bag. Hygd&rsquo;s going to love it. I hope she will. He also talks about keeping one of the lighters even though Fisher says Arquette doesn&rsquo;t smoke anymore.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arquette tells the prisoners that they&rsquo;ll be kept in a special cell where Melydice can visit them. Melydice interrupts, saying he's making another mistake by keeping them. Arqutte says it&rsquo;s better to keep them out of others&rsquo; hands, even though there are other ways of doing that. The prisoners also have weapons and defences that are good for Helvetia. Melydice leans back into her seat: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say I didn't warn you, Mr. Arquette.&rdquo; Arquette trusts her to take care of him when he gets over his head.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;m writing part of this as we drive back to headquarters. I also take another cat lamp: something for Molly&rsquo;s birthday. She&rsquo;s still young. She might like it. Yona takes two of them. Tatsu and Amaia take incense.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We arrive at headquarters. Fucking Arquette had the same idea as me and gave his cat lamp to Molly! Melydice tells her to throw it away because it&rsquo;s &ldquo;touched by devils&rdquo;. I think it&rsquo;s more important for her to know they were left next to blood and semen samples. I give my second cat lamp to Molly since I don&rsquo;t know what to do with a spare. I tell her to not listen to Melydice, but that she may want to wash her hands because of the blood and semen samples. I clarify that the samples weren&rsquo;t on the bed. They were in the tubes. So the lamps are at least </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">that </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">clean.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arquette and Fisher talk to each other in French as we follow them into an office. Arquette says we did good. And the bastard reveals he made us wear the uniforms to make the mission harder for us! He wants us to make sure we have the right clothes with the right situation. Obviously we already know that. A fucking six year old would know that!</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also reveals the police were under his pay. Apparently, when the cops at the apartment called their office, it also went to Helvetia. This won&rsquo;t always be the case for our operations, though. Then he talks about the other Helvetia branches (we&rsquo;re in the South American one). The North American branch was killed off. A prisoner from there either escaped or was broken out. The African branch killed themselves. The Asian branch is dying out. There&rsquo;s only Europe, Antarctica, South America, and Australia left. Melydice raises an eyebrow at Arquette. I can hear her say &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&rsquo;ll get a message in late April to get our clearances, whatever that means. We&rsquo;re also supposed to get &ldquo;mandated therapy sessions&rdquo; as well. I also don&rsquo;t understand what that means, but I don&rsquo;t care either. Because of the list of 20 we gathered, we got paid well. Very well. And most importantly, I can finally go home.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My flight home isn&rsquo;t until tomorrow, so I&rsquo;m writing this from my hotel room while lying on my bed. To be honest, I don&rsquo;t know why I wrote this. I thought this would&rsquo;ve been like those books you like to read. But even if you were here and I was stuck in Helvetia, I would never show this to you. It&rsquo;s sick. And I&rsquo;ll get killed for that, too.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess I can&rsquo;t help it. Maybe in another world where all this was just make-believe, you would&rsquo;ve liked reading these. And it&rsquo;s always nice to write to you. It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re still here, listening to me. And I would really like you to be here right now.</span></p>
