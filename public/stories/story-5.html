        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px;">Once upon a time, there was a mother duck who lived on a farm. She sat on her eggs in her nest all day long. It was lonely, but she must keep her eggs warm until they hatch.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px;">Many days later, one yellow duckling finally hatched out! Then another yellow duckling, and then another one again. One by one, all the eggs began to crack. Soon, the mother duck was surrounded by fluffy yellow ducklings. She quacked with joy. Finally, all her babies were here!</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px;">She counted them before their first swim &mdash; one, two, three, four, five, six&hellip;</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px;">Oh no! One large egg was still in the nest. It needed more time and care. So the mother duck sat back down in her nest to keep it warm and safe.</span></em></p>

    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dark night. A loud night. The landline phone rang and Elmira Golubev picked it up.</span></p>
    <div class="indented">
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hello? How can I help you?&rdquo;</span></em></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Эльмира. Эльмира!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ingush. She complied with no hesitation. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The children. Please. Please take care of them.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Slow down. What's wrong?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;They're coming. I can't explain now. Please, Elmira. My children. They&rsquo;re all I have left in life.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Okay, okay,&rdquo; Elmira stood. She knew the man was not one to talk, and never one to call. &ldquo;Address?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man gutted it out. Elmira plucked a pen from a cup and scrawled his words onto paper.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going there now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Are you&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px;">The next day, the large egg started to crack. Out stepped a duckling much, much larger than all the other ducklings. He was not yellow, but dark-grey instead. His beak was black and he walked with a funny wobble. The yellow ducklings pointed and quacked at him. What is that? He cannot be one of us! I have never seen such an ugly duckling!</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px;">The mother duck scolded the yellow ducklings. Be nice to your brother! So the other ducklings stopped. But when she was gone, they continued pointing and quacking at the Ugly Duckling. You are ugly! You cannot play with us. You walk weird! You cannot keep up with us.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px;">One day, one of the yellow ducklings yelled at the Ugly Duckling. You are hideous to look at! Go away! We don&rsquo;t like you! The yellow ducklings chased the Ugly Duckling, and the Ugly Duckling ran far, far away.</span></em></p>

    <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">25 February 2010</span></em></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one knew if Gavrill Vorobyev was guilty or innocent of &ldquo;The Walmart Incident". Not the attorneys with irrefutable evidence that he was in two places at once, not the witnesses called to share their contradictory testimonies, and not the press who fed the public with conspiracies. So, Gavrill&rsquo;s trial ended inconclusively. The judge ruled that the police were to continue their investigation. And for as long as their investigation was unsolved, Gavrill was to be imprisoned over a thousand kilometers away, in Edmonton Institution.</span></p>
    <div class="indented">
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was three years ago. Elmira had since kept his children under her care in Children&rsquo;s Hope Foundation, the local orphanage she worked at. Gavrill didn&rsquo;t want his children to be fostered or adopted, so Elmira kept a constant eye on them instead. She could afford it &mdash; if she wasn&rsquo;t asleep, she was at the orphanage. Sometimes, she was on the administration team. Sometimes, she was a counsellor for the children. Sometimes, she was a tutor. And sometimes, she was a caretaker, like when five-year-old Hygd Vorobyev refused to touch her workbook.</span></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to learn Ingush,&rdquo;</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hygd declared one day, in English.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hygd and her older siblings, Hrodwyn and Merethel, were in Elmira&rsquo;s office. Its size allowed the room to be transformed into a small classroom. They were here for their daily Ingush lesson Elmira promised their father.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Elmira replied in Ingush. &ldquo;I thought you liked learning Ingush. Look, your siblings are doing the same, too.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo;</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hygd shook her head.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elmira glanced down at the photocopy of an Ingush textbook. She had modified it to fit her curriculum. Next to it was the Ingush workbook she wrote herself.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She took in a deep breath. &ldquo;Hygd, it&rsquo;s Ingush class, so you&rsquo;re learning Ingush.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Why do I need&mdash;&rdquo;</span></em></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;If you keep speaking English, that means you need to learn more Ingush!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hygd frowns. &ldquo;I want to learn English instead!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;But your English is perfectly fine. You use it all the time in school!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I talk to you and my siblings in Ingush more than I talk to my friends in English. It&rsquo;s seven days of Ingush and only five days of English. If you don&rsquo;t teach me, I&rsquo;ll get worse!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;If you want to learn English so badly, fine. I can teach it to you. But now, you learn Ingush. Learning Ingush will not make your English worse.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t want to learn Ingush anymore.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elmira furrowed her brows. &ldquo;If you stop learning Ingush, how can you talk to your father, hm?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hygd&rsquo;s voice quietened. She looked away. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There it was. Elmira&rsquo;s face softened. She put a gentle hand on Hygd&rsquo;s back. &ldquo;Hygd, what happened? Did your friends at school talk about your father again?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hygd said nothing at first, but her silence was broken by a quivering lip and a scrunched nose. She nodded, and wet words bubbled out of her mouth. &ldquo;Cassey is having a birthday party, but her mom doesn&rsquo;t want me to go. Cassey said it&rsquo;s because daa&rsquo;s not a good person. Auntie Elmira, am I not a good person, too?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elmira brushed Hygd&rsquo;s orange hair back. &ldquo;Oh, Hygd&hellip; you are a good person. You are the kindest, sweetest little girl. Your father is a good person, as well.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Then why wasn&rsquo;t I invited?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Because Cassey&rsquo;s mom was wrong. Grown-ups make mistakes all the time, Hygd.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Then what about daa?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elmira pursed her lips. &ldquo;Sometimes, bad things happen to good people, but that doesn&rsquo;t make them bad. Do you believe your father is a good person?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hygd nodded.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Do you believe it with all your heart?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hygd sniffled and nodded even harder.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s what really matters. Okay, Hygd?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hygd nodded again. &ldquo;But I still don&rsquo;t want to learn Ingush. I don&rsquo;t want to be like vosha and jisha-vosha.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with Merethel and Hrodwyn?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;No one wants to talk to vosha because he&rsquo;s not good at English. Jisha-vosha doesn&rsquo;t want to talk to other people, and now they don&rsquo;t have friends.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elmira thought for a moment. She offered a smile. &ldquo;Hygd, do you want to see photos of your father and mother in Ingushetia?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hygd&rsquo;s eyes lit up. &ldquo;Yes, please!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elmira smiled. &ldquo;I will show them after class. You can ask your father about them when we visit him, but you can only do that if you learn Ingush!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Mm&hellip; okay. Then I want to learn!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elmira taught Hygd the language of her family. After that, she took Gavrill&rsquo;s photo album from the storage room and showed Hygd the memories of her family.</span></p>
    </div>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;</span></p>
    <div class="block">
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px;">A storm began. The Ugly Duckling tried to look for a warm place. He went to a barn, and he went to a house. But no matter where he went, everyone laughed at him. The Ugly Duckling hid inside a bush, cold and wet and alone.</span></em></p>
    </div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hygd? Hygd?! Have you seen Hygd? Do you know where she is?&rdquo;</span></em></p>
    <div class="indented">
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was nighttime. Elmira pushed her way through the sea of children being ushered to sleep. She went from room to room, asking the orphanage staff and the children they tucked into bunk-beds, if they had seen the orange-haired girl. No one had &mdash; not her siblings nor her friends. When the orphanage grew quiet with sleep, the orphanage staff joined Elmira&rsquo;s search. The other staff fanned out through the building, while Elmira checked every room Hygd visited and was last seen at.</span></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hygd? Oh, where did that girl go?&rdquo;</span></em></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A streak of light caught Elmira&rsquo;s attention. The door to the storage room was cracked open. Elmira frowned. She sighed and pushed the door. Of course Hygd would be here. As expected, a large suitcase was opened. Spilled open beside it was a thick, old photo album. Curled up near it was Hygd, fast asleep.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elmira opened her mouth to scold the girl, until she noticed Hygd clutching a photograph to her chest. Slowly, Elmira bunched up her skirt and knelt next to Hygd. She reached and gently opened Hygd&rsquo;s hand, upturning the photograph.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px;">When the storm ended, the Ugly Duckling found an empty lake. He looked in the water and saw a reflection from above. A flock of large birds flew over him gracefully. Their bodies were pure white and slender. They were the most beautiful birds he had ever seen.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px;">He kept watching them until the last white bird disappeared. Oh, how he wished to join them! But he was too young and could not fly. And he was too ugly. The beautiful, white birds would never want to fly with an ugly bird.</span></em></p>
    </div>
    <div class="indented">
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elmira looked at the old photograph. Hrodwyn was at the front, beaming. Next to them, Merethel shyly smiled. Their mother &mdash; Elmira&rsquo;s best friend &mdash; sat in a chair next to the two children. Her bright smile was unrivalled by her blazing hair of fire. The infant she cradled, Hygd, shared her hair. Behind them, Gavrill stood tall and proud. His toothy grin matched Hrodwyn&rsquo;s. In each arm, he carried a child &mdash; one boy, one girl, both brunettes and both with the same face.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elmira looked back at Hygd. She sighed, then tapped Hygd&rsquo;s shoulder.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;...Mm?&rdquo; Hygd rolled her head.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hygd Vorobyev, you should not be here. Come now. Put the photo back where you found it, give me the room key, and go to bed.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The little girl rubbed her eyes and looked at the photograph. Her head drooped. &ldquo;Sorry...&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;For what?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;For taking your keys without asking you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elmira&rsquo;s expression remained stern, but her voice softened. &ldquo;If you want to look at the photos again, simply ask me. There is no need to be sneaky, yes? You are old enough to ask questions, and I will always let you see photos of your family.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The little girl nodded, her eyes still heavy with sleep. &ldquo;Okay...&rdquo;</span></p>
    </div>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;</span></p>
    <div class="block">
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px;">Winter came. The Ugly Duckling had no home. A farmer found him freezing in the cold. Poor thing! So the farmer carried the Ugly Duckling into his house.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px;">The Ugly Duckling was glad for the warm fire. But the farmer's children were loud and noisy. Look, a duckling! Let's play with it! Let's chase it around! The poor Ugly Duckling was scared. He ran away from the house into the cold.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px;">The Ugly Duckling was alone again. He wobbled on a frozen lake to a cave. It was a place for him to hide, and it would not be as cold inside there.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px;">For the rest of the cold winter, the Ugly Duckling stayed there. Oh, how he missed his mother! He hoped she would find him one day.</span></em></p>

    <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">13 February 2017. Afternoon.</span></em></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one knew where Gavrill Vorobyev went. All his children knew was that he was called to work. He packed his bags, changed into his uniform, and hugged the children farewell. Ten minutes later, he was gone.</span></p>
    <div class="indented">
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was nineteen hours ago. Silence followed his departure among his children. And silence continues to follow twelve-year-old Hygd into her school day. She didn&rsquo;t talk to her classmates. She didn&rsquo;t sit with her friends during lunch and recess. She stayed in her homeroom to sit in a corner and draw instead. This is what her homeroom teacher tells Hrodwyn, who dropped their work shift to pick up their younger siblings from school.</span></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hygd is, you know, a very bright girl,&rdquo;</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> her homeroom teacher says, clutching her arms against the frigid cold. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;She's very cheerful, she gets along with her classmates very well, and is very talkative. But today&hellip; I know she has bad days, but it doesn&rsquo;t make her withdrawn for the entire day.&rdquo;</span></em></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the effort to keep the conversation out of earshot, Hygd hears it all, even through her earmuffs. She hears Hrodwyn mumble something about adjusting to family matters, then hears her homeroom teacher ask if her father will come to school events and meetings. Hrodwyn says he will, and that they&rsquo;ll translate for him.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hygd can hear her homeroom teacher force a smile. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I look forward to seeing him.&rdquo;</span></em></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The walk from school to home takes a bit over the usual twenty minutes, thanks to unshovelled snow and frozen pavements. Hrodwyn breaks the silence in Ingush. &ldquo;Hygd, how are you feeling?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hygd kicks blue road salt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hrodwyn takes her gloved hand and squeezes it. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about daa. He&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merethel, who has been walking with his hands in his pockets, plucks his earphone out of his ear. &ldquo;Yeah, he&rsquo;ll be fine. It&rsquo;s not the first time he has done something like this.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not?&rdquo; Hygd looks up.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Mmhm,&rdquo; Hrodwyn nods. &ldquo;He used to be in a rebel army in Ingushetia. I think that&rsquo;s why he was hired in the first place&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Mmhm,&rdquo; Hrodwyn nods again. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember a lot of it, but I remember that when we were still living there, he sometimes left home to fight. That&rsquo;s what naana said, at least. So I&rsquo;m sure daa will be safe.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dry scoff from Merethel. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">that</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but okay.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hrodwyn tilts their head. &ldquo;Then what were you thinking of?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Daa leaving,&rdquo; Merethel&rsquo;s hands slip back into his pockets. &ldquo;It used to happen all the time when we first moved to Canada. We barely saw him. He&rsquo;d be gone before we went to bed. He&rsquo;d tell </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to put us into bed.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because he had to work, Merethel. He had </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">two</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> jobs.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I know! I&rsquo;m just saying,&rdquo; Merethel smiles, his tone light and innocent.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hygd&rsquo;s gaze lowers. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember that.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Merethel says. &ldquo;You were, like, three. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m telling you now. He&rsquo;d leave at night and come back when we were asleep. Then we&rsquo;d have to wake up super early because he had to wake up super early for his job, too. He&rsquo;d drop us off at school, pick us up later, stay for a while, and then disappear at night again.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hygd straightens up. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with that? Daa was just working really hard.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I never said there was anything wrong with that. The real problem isn&rsquo;t him leaving or him dying. The real problem is when he comes home. Don&rsquo;t tell me you forgot what he was like, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">jisha-vosha</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&rdquo; he looks at Hrodwyn. &ldquo;If he came home from a regular job like </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">that</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, what will he be like when he comes home from </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">this </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">job?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hygd furrows her brows. &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merethel looks down at her. &ldquo;Daa was scary, Hygd.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;No he wasn&rsquo;t. He was never scary!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, yeah? What do you remember about him before he came back from prison, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hygd presses her lips tight together. She thinks about the photographs in the album. &ldquo;He was nice&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Ha! You don&rsquo;t remember what he was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like! That&rsquo;s fine, obviously. You were too young &mdash; lucky for you. Frankly, I&rsquo;m surprised that he came back from prison all </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">fine </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">friendly</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but let&rsquo;s give him a few months on this job and see how he turns out, shall we?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merethel!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; Hrodwyn glares at him. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re as smart as your mouth, you know you&rsquo;re being unfair to daa right now.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not making up anything, am I?&rdquo; Merethel raises his hands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just pointing out what has happened before. It&rsquo;s for Hygd&rsquo;s sake, so she won&rsquo;t be so disappointed.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hygd&rsquo;s nose scrunches. &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t believe you. Daa is a good person! He even got you eyeliner! You&rsquo;re just stupid!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;No, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">you&rsquo;re</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stupid! You&rsquo;re the one believing things without any facts-OW! What the hell?!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hygd punches Merethel&rsquo;s arm. Before Hrodwyn can say anything, she grabs her backpack&rsquo;s straps and races down the street, clambering through snow.</span></p>
    </div>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;</span></p>
    <div class="block">
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px;">Spring came, and summer passed. The Ugly Duckling struggled to live. He did not only struggle with surviving the harsh winter, but he also struggled with being alone. Oh, how lonesome loneliness was! How lonesome it was to be ugly and unloved!</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px;">When the leaves started to change colours again, the Ugly Duckling heard strong wings flapping. The beautiful, white birds have returned. Seeing them reminded him of how ugly and lonely he was. He could not bear to live with that anymore.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px;">He leaves the cave and throws himself at the beautiful birds, even though he knows they will hate him. It is better to be killed by such beautiful birds than to live a life of ugliness!</span></em></p>
    </div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time Hrodwyn and Merethel arrive home, Hgyd&rsquo;s boots are in the boot tray, her coat is hanging by the front door, and she herself is curled up in her bed, facing the wall, with a small owl plush to her chest &mdash; the plush she </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">swears</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> she remembers her father giving to her in Canada.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <div class="indented">
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swathed in her blanket, she listens to Hrodwyn scold Merethel from the living room. Merethel eventually sighs and opens the bedroom door.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hygd? I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hygd stays still and says nothing.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another sigh, but not one of frustration. &ldquo;I mean it, Hygd. I&rsquo;m sorry. That was unfair and mean of me to say to you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;...I&rsquo;m sorry for calling you stupid, too.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She hears Merethel step closer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. I deserved that. But don&rsquo;t make it a habit.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hint of a smile grows on Hygd&rsquo;s lips. She forces it away. &ldquo;You should say sorry to daa, too. He doesn&rsquo;t deserve what you said.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well, he isn&rsquo;t here, is he?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s besides the point!&rdquo; Hygd finally moves. She sits up to frown at Merethel from her upper bunk. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still mean.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merethel opens his mouth, then changes his mind. &ldquo;Okay, whatever. Believe what you want, but don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t warn you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hygd shrinks beneath her blanket. She curls back up in her bed.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;...Jisha-vosha&rsquo;s&nbsp; going to order pizza for dinner, by the way,&rdquo; Merethel starts. &ldquo;What do you want? Cheese pizza, as usual?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yeah, sure. Thanks,&rdquo; Hygd mumbles.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merethel leaves. Hrodwyn enters to check in on Hygd afterwards. They comfort her to the best of their abilities with their strong face and gentle words. But Hygd knows that there&rsquo;s only one thing that can comfort her now.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Hrodwyn leaves the bedroom, when the background noise of TV chatter begins, Hygd slips out to go into the adjacent bedroom &mdash; her father&rsquo;s room. Standing by a wall is the same, familiar suitcase. She lowers it, opens it, and sits on the floor across it. The suitcase is mostly empty &mdash; most of its possessions have been moved to dressers and shelves. But what she hoped to find remains in the suitcase&rsquo;s hollow shell: the family photo album, sitting dejected amid dark and dust.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Album in hand, she returns to her bedroom as silently as she left it. She climbs into her bed, nestles herself into her cove of pillows and blankets, and opens the album.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hygd has long memorised the order of photographs in this album, but she still finds comfort in its predictability and its familiar faces. First, there are photographs of domed buildings, street markets, and green parks. These backdrops eventually feature people: there&rsquo;s daa, there&rsquo;s Auntie Elmira, and there&rsquo;s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Next are photographs of her much-younger father. They are all candid, except for the one of him lying in bed with a thick book in hand. He looks straight at the camera, extremely bored.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hygd grins. It&rsquo;s one of her favourite pictures of her father, and it&rsquo;s one of her earliest memories of him &mdash; his gentle smile when Hygd showed him the photograph, his soft laugh as he told the story behind it. And the warmth he exuded only shone brighter when Hygd showed him photographs from the album&rsquo;s next section</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px;">Instead of chasing him, the white birds welcomed and accepted him. What a surprise! How could this be?</span></em></p>
    </div>
    <div class="indented">
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hygd&rsquo;s eyes always linger on this section. It contains multiple photographs of a figure with Hygd&rsquo;s orange hair and Hygd&rsquo;s large eyes. In one photograph, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">She</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> writes at a desk. In another, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">She&rsquo;s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> curled up with a book. Hygd&rsquo;s favourite is one where </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">She</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> looks straight at Hygd and blows a kiss at her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px;">The Ugly Duckling looked at his reflection in the water. His reflection looked like one of the beautiful white birds. Why was this white bird so close to him?</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px;">He jumped back. The reflection jumped back, too. He stretched his neck, and the reflection of the white bird stretched its long neck, too.</span></em></p>
    </div>
    <div class="indented">
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hygd carefully traces </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> face. She wonders if she will sound like </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She continues going through the old photo album. There are more photographs of her father, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the life they once lived. Hygd immerses herself in these pockets of time, imagining the sepia-tinted rooms making up the four walls she spent her days in, trying to steal the memories of the smiling faces that existed long before she did.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the more she tries, the more she claws a hole in herself. There were still so many faces she didn&rsquo;t know, so many names she was never told, even if they once shared her blood. But her older siblings and her father know them all. Jisha-vosha, vosha, daa: they all got to talk to these people and hug them and hold their hands. They know all about little things that made memories of these people come to life. Hygd doesn&rsquo;t. She never will. Not if Hrodwyn keeps saying she&rsquo;s too young to know some things about their family. Not if Merethel keeps telling things that she believes, with all her heart, are wrong.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even if they do tell her everything one day, will she feel the same way as her family did in the photographs?</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px;">The beautiful white birds asked why the Ugly Duckling wasn't joining them. Stay with us, they said!</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px;">Finally, the Ugly Duckling realised what happened. He was no longer a big, grey duckling who walked strangely. He had become a beautiful white bird. He had become a swan!</span></em></p>
    </div>
    <div class="indented">
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last photograph in the album is the one Hygd looks at most. There are many family pictures in the album, but there is only one with Hygd. She was an infant, and she was sitting in </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lap. After that, nothing.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hygd lies down. She closes the photo album. She hugs it, wraps her blanket around her tight, and imagines her family embracing her to sleep.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px;">The Once-Ugly Duckling played with the beautiful swans. They swam together and ate together. He had never been so happy!</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px;">Soon, the sky became cold and dark. It was time to leave. The flock flew to the sky, and the Once-Ugly Duckling spread his wings to join his new family.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px;">The End</span></em></p>
