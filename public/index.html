        <p>To reunite with his three children after ten years, Gavrill Vorobyev sacrifices his life and sanity to hunt horrors beyond this world. Now, his family must learn to rely on each other while being haunted by past, present, and future.</p>
        <p><i>SPARROW FLIGHT</i> is a collection of short stories and comics about the Vorobyev family. It is set in the world of <i>Delta Green: The Role-Playing Game</i> where cosmic horrors exist in the shadows of our world, and threaten the fragile, but deeply cherished bond between Hrodwyn, Merethel, Hygd, and their father Gavrill. But despite trying to overcome the unspoken trauma of living through war, fleeing to a new country, and being forcefully separated for ten years, the family knows their reunion can end in death, or worse.</p>
        <p>This collection is blend of historical war fiction, slice-of-life family drama, and psychological horror, with sparks of hurt/comfort, hope, and wholesomeness. It also follows an Delta Green campaign called <i>Armageddon</i>, written and run by Mint and ideated by TheRoyalZealot. My player character, Gavrill Vorobyev, is known as Agent HROTHGAR in Helvetia Limited: a powerful but quickly-crumbling international organisation dedicated to eliminating the Unnatural in the dark.</p>
        <p>Stories are written as the game progresses. It started in 23 February 2024. It is still ongoing. The Vorobyevs' fate remains unknown.</p>
