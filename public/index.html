        <p><i>SPARROW FLIGHT</i> is a collection of short stories and comics about the Vorobyev family and the past that haunts them. It is set in the world of <i>Delta Green: The Role-Playing Game</i> where cosmic horrors exist in the world we live in today and threaten the fragile, but deeply cherished bond between the Vorobyev children and their father. But despite trying to overcome the unspoken trauma of war, fleeing to a new country, and being forcefully separated for ten years, everyone knows the familyâ€™s reunion can end in death or worse.</p>
        <p>This blend of historical war fiction, family drama, and psychological horror with sparks of hurt/comfort, hope, and wholesomeness follows an Delta Green campaign called <i>Helvetia Ltd: Apocalypse Rising</i>, run by my friend. My character, Gavrill Vorobyev, is known as Agent HROTHGAR in Helvetia Limited: a powerful but quickly-crumbling international organisation dedicated to eliminating the Unnatural in the dark.</p>
        <p>Stories are written as the game progresses. The campaign is still ongoing. The Vorobyevs' fate remains unknown.</p>
        <p>If you feel a sensitive topic was mishandled or if an additional content warning is needed, do not hesitate to contact me. I aim to write from a place of empathy and respect, not of ignorance and glamour; and my limited experience and knowledge only gives me more room to learn and grow.</p>
