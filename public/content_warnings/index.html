    <h1 style="text-align: center">CONTENT WARNINGS</h1>

	<p>This collection explores the unhealthy effects of trauma, surpressed grief, and toxic relationships. It also delves into family dysfunction, guilt, and fear. Violence of varying degrees is aso present, Though the heart of this collection is the Vorobyevs trying to overcome these obstacles through love, understanding, and patience, healing is painful and not guaranteed.</p>
	<p>If you feel a sensitive topic was mishandled or if an additional content warning is needed, do not hesitate to contact me. I aim to write from a place of empathy and respect, not of ignorance and glamour; and my limited experience and knowledge only gives me more room to learn and grow.</p>
    <p>This list of warnings will be updated as stories are released.</p>
